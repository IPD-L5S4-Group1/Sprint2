User Persona: The Anxious Job Seeker
Name: Alex Chen (Chen Tongxue)
Role: Fresh Graduation Senior (Computer Science Major)
Status: Preparing for spring recruitment and in urgent need of a high-quality resume
Quote: "I've sent out 20 resumes but haven't heard back. I don't know what's wrong with it."
Bio & Context
Alex possesses solid professional skills (GPA 3.8) but lacks experience in resume writing. He doesn't know how to describe project experiences to pass the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) used by large companies. The queue for appointments with career center counselors at his university is too long, and generic online templates are overly one-size-fits-all. He is currently extremely anxious and hopes for a tool that can quickly identify issues with his resume and provide specific revision suggestions.
Core Needs
Instant Feedback: Doesn’t want to wait days for manual feedback; needs to get the resume score immediately.
Mobile Accessibility: Able to upload and check resumes anytime, anywhere—preferably with a mobile preview function.
Specific & Actionable Suggestions: Instead of vague comments like "poor typesetting," specify issues such as "inappropriate use of verbs" or "lack of data support."
Pain Points
Can’t figure out why resumes never receive responses (fall into the void).
Typesetting/formatting always gets distorted across different devices.
Doesn’t know how to optimize keywords for specific positions (e.g., backend development).
